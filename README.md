# deeplearning-tensorflow
Source code of my Tensorflow Sessions that I conducted at HERE Mumbai 

Notebooks 1 to 5 will take you thorugh the following

# Creating your first tensorflow program to solve a basic optimization problem using linear regression 
   1. Tensorflow variables
   2. Tensorflow Constants
   3. Placeholders
   4. Creating and running the computational graph
   5. Brief overview of what is inbuilt in tensorflow
# Building a Stop Traffic sign classifier based on subset of data obtained from GTSRB dataset 
   1. Working with images using PIL (Python Imaging Library)
   2. Plotting images using MatplotLib in Jupyter notebooks
   3. Building Neural Net in tensorflow
   4. Training the Neural Net
   5. Obeserving the loss
   6. Tensorboard to see intermediate results
